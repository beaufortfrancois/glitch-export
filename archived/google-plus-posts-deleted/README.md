We automatically detect when you’re creating a Firebase app, and magically provide the option to deploy it straight to Firebase — directly from within Glitch. As well as view the Firebase console, and the deployed app. So you can combine the power and simplicity of Glitch with the extensive tools provided by Firebase.
