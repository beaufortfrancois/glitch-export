# Make your web app installable

This glitch contains the web manifest and the required fields to make a Web App [installable](https://web.dev/install-criteria/).

To try installability the page also has to be served
over https and _must not_ be served in an iframe.

To try out the install button follow the [instructions here](https://web.dev/codelab-make-installable/).
